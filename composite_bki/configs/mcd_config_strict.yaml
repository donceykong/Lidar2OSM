# MCD Dataset Configuration - Strict Confusion Matrix
# Configuration for Multi-Class Dataset (MCD) semantic segmentation
# Uses a strict "identity-like" confusion matrix where predictions are expected to match OSM priors exactly.

# Label definitions: raw_id -> label_name
labels:
  0: barrier
  1: bike
  2: building
  3: chair
  4: cliff
  5: container
  6: curb
  7: fence
  8: hydrant
  9: infosign
  10: lanemarking
  11: noise
  12: other
  13: parkinglot
  14: pedestrian
  15: pole
  16: road
  17: shelter
  18: sidewalk
  19: stairs
  20: structure-other
  21: traffic-cone
  22: traffic-sign

# Confusion matrix (8x6): rows=predicted classes, cols=prior classes
# Prior classes: [roads, parking, sidewalks, vegetation, buildings, fences]
# Strict Mode: Strong diagonals, low off-diagonals.
# Rows:
# 0: Roads
# 1: Parking
# 2: Sidewalks
# 3: Vegetation
# 4: Buildings
# 5: Fences
# 6: Vehicles (Dynamic)
# 7: Other (Objects)
